    process your personal data. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy in general or any part of it, you should not access the Platform.
    <br><br> Information we collect from you
    <br> Information you provide about yourself: in order to join the Parenting-ASD community, you must provide a name (either your real name or a username that does not identify you), e-mail address, your role (parent, grandparent or caregiver), your gender, country. While participating in the community or otherwise using the Platform, you can also provide additional information such as your profile image, your story, diagnosis treatment information and other health-related information.
    <br> You represent to us that you hold parental responsibility
    over the child and therefore you are entitled to consent on the child's behalf to us processing his or her information, or that you have obtained consent from the child to share the child's information on the Platform, where the applicable law
    requires the child's consent. In the latter case, you represent that you have provided the child with a copy of this privacy policy and explained it to the child.
    <br> Information you provide about doctors, specialists or other providers: we collect information such as name, e-mail address, phone number, business address and area of specialization of health care providers that you add to our Platform directory.
    <br> How we use the information we collect
    <br> This Platform is about connecting and learning from other people going through the same thing as you. We provide areas on our Platform where you can post information about yourself and others, communicate with and ask questions of others,
    post recommendations of doctors or other establishments, and upload content (e.g. pictures, videos, audio files, etc.).

    the information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution and only post information that you are happy to share publicly.
    <br><br> Deletion Request Rights
    <br><br> You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and retained. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete)
    your personal information from our records.
    <br><br> We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us to:
    <br><br> Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise
    perform our contract with you.
    <br> Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities.
    <br> Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.
    <br> Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights, or exercise another right provided for by law.
    <br> Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with us.

    <br> Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.

    we will ask you to verify your identity.
    <br><br> You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:
    <br><br> Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative. Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly
    understand, evaluate, and respond to it. We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. Making
    a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.

    <br> This social network is password-protected.
